# Student Record Management System  
ðŸš€ **A console-based application for managing student records using C++ and file handling.**

This project is designed to help users manage student records efficiently. It uses **C++**, **linked lists**, and **file handling** to add, view, search, delete, and store student data persistently.  

---

## Features  
- Add a new student record  
- Display all student records  
- Search for a student by ID  
- Delete a student record by ID  
- Save data to a file (`students.txt`)  
- Load data from a file (`students.txt`)  

---

## How to Run  
./StudentManagement

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash
g++ Student_Record_Management.cpp -o StudentManagement

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Student-Record-Management-System.git
cd Student-Record-Management-System

--- Student Record Management ---
1. Add Student
2. Display Students
3. Search Student
4. Delete Student
5. Save and Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter ID: 101
Enter Name: John Doe

File Details
Student_Record_Management.cpp:
Contains the main source code for the application.

students.txt:
A file used to store student data persistently. This file is automatically created when the program is run and data is saved.

How It Works
Adding Records:

The user enters a student's ID, name, and marks.
The data is stored in a linked list in memory.
Displaying Records:

Displays all student data in a tabular format.
Searching Records:

Finds and displays a specific student by their unique ID.
Deleting Records:

Removes a student's data from the linked list using their ID.
File Handling:

Saves all records into students.txt when exiting the program.
Loads existing records from students.txt when the program starts.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Concepts: Linked Lists, File Handling
Advantages of This Project
Demonstrates the use of linked lists for dynamic data management.
Teaches basic file handling for data persistence.
Beginner-friendly project to practice C++ concepts.
